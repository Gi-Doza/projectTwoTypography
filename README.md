# Project 2: Typography

By: Gian Mendoza

# Project Overview

I chose the text from the first verse of the song “Amazing Grace” because it means a lot to me personally. The line, “I once was lost, but now am found,” connects strongly with my own spiritual journey. Since the pandemic, I have been active in my church community, and through that, my faith and relationship with God have grown. I’ve found a sense of belonging in this community that I didn’t really experience before — whether in the Navy, with my secular friends, at school, or at work.

The words I picked show this personal change. Just like the song talks about being saved and finding clarity, I’ve felt a renewal in my own life through faith. This project is my way of showing that journey, not just through the text, but also through the animations and transitions, which represent the steps I’ve taken from being lost to being found.
